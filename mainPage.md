# Notes on styling

### div boxes

- overflow - when there is a lot of text and we want the box to be the one size the css elements to use is 

```css
overflow: scroll;
```
It keeps it neat. 

### Colour transparentcy

- If we want a colour faded in oder to see the background image or for whatever reason RGBA is the type of colour format that is easiest to use.

for examlple 

```css
rgba(141,43, 0, 0.75);
```
The last number, the 0.75 is what makes it transperant.
