            <p>This book is important so we can learn our younger kids, you know? Especially little ones.
                When they get older they'll know everything then. Especially bush things, what we've been saying about.
                When we take older people and all, out on any trips. But the main one: the little ones got to start too.
                Learning them everything. So that tey can satrt growing up, they'll know know what the old people are giving them.</p>

            <p>I would like to say, my point of view, on this book, abou the plants and lundu, mayi: it's important. For our Bunuba young people.
                To understand, from our Bunuba language side, and from gardiya side, English side. Especially for the Bunuba rangers. It's really importantfor those younger ones growing up.
                Because they got to learn, the language is there.
                You know, when they go out, work out on country, they got to talk, call them all that plants, mayi, bush tucker in their own language too, not just only English.
                So, for me I feel it is important for this book, to acknowlegde our Bunuba Elders past and present.
                I want to thank my mum, Emily Brooking, because I used to get a lot of help from her. And Ngalu (Patsy), Auntie Susan Hoad and Mona Oscar.
                Well thsi book, it's really important.
